# My process

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design
- Next.js + React.js

## Improved with

- TODO - Autoprefixer to increase browser coverage

## Tested with

- TODO - WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
- Jest + React Testing Library + User Event Testing Library

## Iterations

### Iteration 1

See the product list on my mobile device.

### Iteration 2

See the product list on my tablet and desktop devices.

### Iteration 3

See the product list properly when I change the default browser font size setting.

### Iteration 4

Allow me (administrator) to change the pictures of the products after the application has been deployed.

## What I learned

### Next.js Server Component rendering

I want to make this project a bit more closer to a real world scenario by

- fetching the product list from a database so products can be added or removed without needing to rebuild the application while
- preserving server-side rendering as a step towards SEO so the shop's products can be find easier while browsing the internet.

To achieve this, I found that the product list should be [rendered server side](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) statically (at build time) but [incrementally regenerated](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) at runtime by invalidating the cache on the server side at regular intervals.

### MongoDB connection

The singleton pattern is preferred to reuse the MongoDB connection, otherwise Next.js' hot reload (on development) and serverless function cold starts can trigger multiple reconnections, which is bad for performance and can exceed Atlas connection limits.

In Node.js, `global` is the global object (like `window` in the browser) and it persists across hot reloads in Next.js development mode. Even if modules are re-imported (due to Next.js hot reload), `global` is not reset. This makes it a perfect candidate to attach the database connection to that.

For a "hot reload safe" cached database connection pool see `app/_lib/database.js`.

### MongoDB model

Recreating the same Mongoose model multiple times should be avoided, as it can cause runtime errors. That is why Mongoose models should be cached as well.

For a safe, cached model example, see `app/_models/product.js`.

### MongoDB URI

The MongoDB URI should be retrieved from an environment variable to prevent hardcoding sensitive credentials (like database username and password) into the codebase. Environment variables for a Next.js project can be saved in a file named `/.env.local`, which:

- is ignored by Git (because Next.jsâ€™s default .gitignore includes .env.local)
- is loaded automatically by Next.js during development and build processes

Later, when deploying the project, environment variables must be provided to the hosting platform (such as Vercel, AWS, etc.), using the platform's environment variable settings.

```javascript
// .env.local

MONGODB_URI =
  "mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@development.jebfnk5.mongodb.net/<DATABASE_NAME>?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<CLUSTER_NAME>";
```

Using mongoose ODM, the collection name is generated from the model name by pluralizing and lowercasing it (e.g for `Product` the collection name will be `products`).

```javascript
const ProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  /* fields */
});
mongoose.model("Product", ProductSchema);
```

The collection name can beforced as well as follows:

```javascript
const ProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    /* fields */
  },
  { collection: "products" } // explicit
);
mongoose.model("Product", ProductSchema);
```

### Async react component unit testing

I found out that the async react components can be unit tested with the react testing library by calling render function in the folloing way:

```javascript
render(await ProductList());
```

### Mocking user modules

Manual mocks are defined by writing a module in a `__mocks__/` subdirectory immediately adjacent to the module. For example, to mock a module called `user` in the `models` directory, create a file called `user.js` and put it in the `models/__mocks__` directory. [Jest - Manual Mocks](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks)

Because I could not find any way automatically mocking my modules (`database.js`, `product.js`) so far, I have written manual mocks.

For Mongoose Product model in `product.js` I used the following mock:

```javascript
const Product = {
  find: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve([])),
};

export default Product;
```

Since the MongoDB database adds automatic `_id` parameter and Mongoose populates the model with it as the `id` property, the mock should reflect this behavio as well:

```javascript
const products = [
  {
    id: 0,
    image: {
      thumbnail: "./assets/images/image-waffle-thumbnail.jpg",
      mobile: "./assets/images/image-waffle-mobile.jpg",
      tablet: "./assets/images/image-waffle-tablet.jpg",
      desktop: "./assets/images/image-waffle-desktop.jpg",
    },
    name: "Waffle with Berries",
    category: "Waffle",
    price: 6.5,
  },
];

Product.find.mockResolvedValue(products);
```
